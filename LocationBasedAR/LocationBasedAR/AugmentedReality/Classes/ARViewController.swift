/**
 *  Augmented Reality View Controller
 *
 *  How to use:
 *  1. Initialize the controller and set the datasource (and other properties if needed)
 *  2. Use the setAnnotations method to set annotations.
 *  3. Present controller modally.
 *  4. Implement ARDataSource to provide annotation view in your data source
 *
 *  Properties maxVerticalLevel, maxVisibleAnnotations and maxDistance can be used to optimize performance.
 *  Use trackingManager.userDistanceFilter and trackingManager.reloadDistanceFilter to set how ofter the data is refreshed/reloaded.

     *  than this value, then it will not be visible.
